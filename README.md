# CryptoClustering

#Overview
**The CryptoClustering project is designed to analyze and cluster cryptocurrencies using K-Means clustering. The primary goal is to identify patterns and group cryptocurrencies based on their market performance over a set period. This project employs both raw data and PCA (Principal Component Analysis)-reduced data for dimensionality reduction, allowing for a more streamlined analysis.**

#Project Structure
#The project contains the following files and directories:

#Crypto_Clustering.ipynb:

#A Jupyter Notebook that contains all the code to preprocess, analyze, and cluster the cryptocurrency market data.
#Includes visualizations such as elbow curves and scatter plots to represent clustering results.
#Resources:

#Contains the dataset crypto_market_data.csv, which includes information about various cryptocurrencies.
#README.md:

#This file, providing a detailed explanation of the project.
